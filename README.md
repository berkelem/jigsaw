# jigsaw
Inspired by a jigsaw puzzle I received as a gift one Christmas. The puzzle contained sixteen square grey pieces that could be flipped upside down, and each of the interconnecting parts were in distinct shapes like arrows, circles and crosses. The box said there were 48 solutions so I tried solving for them all with code.
